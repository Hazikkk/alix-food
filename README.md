Key Features:

🏠 Live API Integration: Harnessing the power of Swiggy's live API, my project seamlessly fetches real-time data from a diverse range of restaurants. Explore a variety of cuisines and discover hidden culinary gems within your vicinity.

🍕 Restaurant Cards: Engage with visually appealing restaurant cards that provide at-a-glance information about each eatery. From mouthwatering images to essential details like ratings and delivery time, these cards aim to enhance the user experience.
